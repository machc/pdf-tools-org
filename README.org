* Introduction
pdf-tools-org is an emacs package that provides integration between pdf-tools and org-mode.
The main features are importing and exporting pdf annotations from/to org files.

* Installation
- clone this repo to $PACKAGEDIR:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd $PACKAGEDIR
git clone https://github.com/pinguim06/pdf-tools-org
#+END_SRC

- add initialization your .emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "$PACKAGEDIR/pdf-tools-org")
(require 'pdf-tools-org)
#+END_SRC

- if you want to auto export the annotations after saving a pdf, also add this:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-hook 'after-save-hook
          (lambda ()
            (when (eq major-mode 'pdf-view-mode) (pdf-tools-org-export-to-org))))
#+END_SRC

* Usage
- Use =(pdf-tools-org-export-to-org)= to export annotations of current pdf file being viewed in PDFView mode to an org file.
- Use =(pdf-tools-org-import-from-org ORGFILE)= to import annotations from ORGFILE.

* Known issues
- Importing is not working quite well yet -- multiple annotations may be merged into one and multiple imports may create duplicates.
